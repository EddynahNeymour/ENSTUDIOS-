		     Hi,there! 
			 I'm an Information Technology Professional specialising in 
			 Software Engineering. My previous profession was in Culinary Arts
			 as a Line Chef. Eventhough I enjoyed cooking, engineering was my foundation
			 in High School. In 2021, I decided to transition back into the Engineering 
			 field by completing a Computer Programming Certification with University 
			 of London and the Google IT Support Certification via Coursera. After
			 completing,I went on to complete a remote internship with JP Morgan Chase & Co in 2022,
			 and got admitted into the Bachelor of Science Computer Science Program at University
			 of London. In March 2023, I completed Skyscanner's Software Engineering Virtual Experience.
			 I am currently an Intern with JP Morgan Chase & Co once again.
			 Thank you for visiting!
